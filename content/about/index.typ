= About

My name is Francesco, and I'm a 22-years-old student at the university of
Bologna. Right now I'm part of the Collegio Superiore, Bologna's excellency
school. I'm currently working towards a Master's in Economics and Econometrics. If you want to know more about why I made this website, check
out #link("/posts/why")[this short post] I made about it!
